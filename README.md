<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This Project sets out to discover whether restaurant health inspection scores are affected by population. My goal is to potentially reveal what some may consider an unexpected cause for low restaurant health inspection scores. This analysis will be performed using three datasets consisting of restaurant inspection data for two major US cities. One dataset for a city with very low population numbers, another with very high numbers, and lastly, a population dataset categorized by zip code</p>
<p>Some of the assumptions we can make are that restaurants in heavily populated areas receive more customers than those lightly populated. We can also assume that as these restaurants take on larger numbers of customers, serving the customer in a satisfactory fashion may take precedence over certain areas that may be considered health inspection criteria. With certain health inspections being performed without warning, at that particular time the establishment stands to receive a low score, or in the least, one that will reflect areas lacking.</p>

<p>As someone who has experience in the food service industry and health inspections, I find this topic particularly inviting. It has the potential to be informative beyond what one would typically think are causes of low health inspection scores.  If a correlation is discovered, it may be useful information primarily to one who is in the position to make changes or improvements to the establishment, but it would also be useful information to the general public or consumer as well.</p>
<p>In addition to the reasons stated above, the dataset for health inspections in Anchorage, AK also interest me on a personal note. A few years ago, my wife and I vacationed in Alaska. This vacation was one I thoroughly enjoyed, and we intend to return some time in the future.  While in Anchorage we were customers to some of the restaurants listed in this dataset. To be able to perform analysis on a place I enjoyed greatly and specifically on restaurants I visited is a rare treat.</p>
